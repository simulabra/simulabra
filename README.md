let's build an object system

compoents

### object
everything is an object (kind of - null, undefined aren't really)
### primitive
the base JS objects we don't want to wrap, like Number or String
mangle the prototypes and ask questions later
### class
specifies the implementation and behavior of instance objects
needs to be bootstrapped
`new` instantiates objects
super + mixins inheritance
### var
smarter than a property
default, type, mutable, load
### method
smarter than a function
### symbol
interned string
### id
URI
### command
objectified callback that does something
### module
### interface
### enum
