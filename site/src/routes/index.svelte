    <div class="landing-point">The world as we know it consists of complex systems, such as in life, the brain, economics, and society.</div>
    <div class="landing-point">These systems are more than the sum of their parts, being composed of a large number of independent agents which interact with each other in a shared environment.</div>
    <div class="landing-point">Various chaotic phenomena emerge out of the collective behavior of these agents, despite each agent having relatively simple behavior.</div>
    <div class="landing-point">These phenomena are difficult to describe logically, so often our own intuitions are more helpful than computers.</div>
    <div class="landing-point">Simulabra is a tool to model and simulate complex systems of independent agents.</div>
    <div class="landing-point">It provides a toolbox of methods: agent-based modeling, system dynamics, and discrete event systems.</div>
    <div class="landing-point">Simple yet powerful programming interface that doesn't require previous experience, as well as integration with Python.</div>
    <div class="landing-point">Tweak, observe, and analyze your model over the course of your experiments and discover scientific insights.</div>
    <div class="landing-point">Alternatives all require programming, and typically have confusing interfaces and other barriers to use.</div>
